# download_mars_images
Download mars images from NASA 

Simple python script to download images collected by curiosity, opportunity and spirit from the nasa website.

Currently it downloads, 125 images (page 1 to 6 depending on availability) for sol 1 to 1000 for all the cameras of the rovers. But this can be changed easily in the script.
